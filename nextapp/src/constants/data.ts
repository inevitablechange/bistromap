  <p>It’s easy to say that <strong>Lisbon</strong> has had a bit of a glow-up over the past decade. This once-hidden gem has been brought into the limelight, thanks in no small part to the culinary buzz created on social media. However, it would be an oversimplification to attribute this transformation solely to trends. The real story is about the hardworking chefs innovating in their kitchens, winemakers toiling under the blazing sun, and entrepreneurs breathing new life into old buildings.</p>
  
  <p>Lisbon has always been a bit of a secret foodie haven, albeit one that often flew under the radar compared to its neighbor, Spain. The city’s love affair with tinned fish, seafood rice, and peri-peri chicken has long been a cornerstone of its food scene. Historically, Lisbon’s culinary offerings were known for their simplicity and understated charm.</p>
  
  <p>Fast forward to 2024, and Lisbon’s dining scene is anything but understated. The city is now home to a slew of new restaurants flexing their culinary muscles. One standout is the restaurant at the Lisbon outpost of the <strong>Hyatt Regency</strong>. This place is a fantastic addition to Lisbon’s vibrant food scene, offering a delightful array of dishes and local wines wrapped in the comfort and reliability of a top-tier hotel.</p>
  
  <p>The Hyatt Regency Lisbon is a bit of a trek from the city center, but it’s well worth the walk. If you’re not staying at the hotel, make your way from Alfama or central Lisbon through the picturesque Belem neighborhood and under the iconic 25 de Abril Bridge. After this journey, you’ll be rewarded with a seat at <strong>ViseVersa</strong> – the Hyatt’s chic Portuguese bistro that’s quickly becoming a must-visit spot in Lisbon.</p>
  
  <p>It’s a bold move to craft a standout dining experience within a major hotel chain in Lisbon. After all, hotel restaurants often cater to a captive audience with modest expectations. But ViseVersa goes above and beyond. The menu features a range of light bites, hearty meals, and a curated drink selection, including excellent Portuguese wines.</p>
  
  <p>The restaurant showcases local ingredients and regional specialties with a few creative twists. For example, their sea bream tartare is served on a pastel-green sauce with Southeast Asian flavors like lime, chili, and ginger, which elevates the dish to new heights. The prawns are juicy and perfectly spiced, and their main courses, including black cod with a vibrant herb sauce, barbecued octopus with savory puy lentils, and Iberico pork with clams, are nothing short of spectacular.</p>
  
  <p>Seasonality is a key focus here, with an emphasis on fresh fish and seafood from the nearby Atlantic. The restaurant's ambiance is a nod to the stylish 70s, with pastel decor and undulating furnishings creating a unique atmosphere. Service is attentive yet unobtrusive, and the sommelier is more than happy to discuss Portuguese wines in depth.</p>
  
  <p>Dessert at ViseVersa is a playful blend of banana, caramel, and cottage cheese – a simple yet delightful finish to a memorable meal. As I wrapped up my evening, I couldn’t help but feel that ViseVersa represents a new chapter in Lisbon’s high-end dining scene, which is thriving.</p>
  <h3>Other top foodie spots in Portugal 2024:</h3>
  <p><strong>Terrace, Martinhal Residence Lisbon</strong></p>
  <p>Terrace is the shining star of the brand-spanking-new Park of Nations in Lisbon, and home to a proper celebration of Portuguese cuisine’s connection with the Far East. There’s a stunning amount of sushi preparation skill on display, and dishes like the rare ahi tuna with tropical fruit salsa, black cod with miso, and lamb vindaloo (an Indo-Portuguese dish worthy of UNESCO status) blew me away.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Ramires, Algarve</strong></p>
  <p>Plenty of eateries hail themselves as the home of peri-peri chicken, but Ramires in the pretty Algarve town of Guia is arguably the most convincing. Constantly packed to the gills with locals seeking that constantly-surprising chili hit, the chefs at Ramires serve peri-peri the way it should be done: piled high on a platter with plenty of the explosive dressing on the side to add yourself. Is it refined? Absolutely not. Is it worth traveling for? Wars have been fought over lesser dishes.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Veneza, Albufeira</strong></p>
  <p>Is it a restaurant in a wine shop, or a wine shop that does food? It’s hard not to be dazzled by the towering shelves and temperature-controlled cellars on display upon walking into Veneza, and it’s equally hard not to be taken aback by the generosity of the chefs, who bring platter after platter of delectable dishes to be shared. The black pork reigned supreme, but special mention must go to the mountains of croquetas, pates, and lighter bites that seemingly never ended. A must-visit, and a world away from the tatty tourist strip this town is unfairly maligned for.</p>

    restaurant: "Osteria Francescana",
    content: `
     <p><strong>Osteria Francescana</strong> in Modena, Italy, is not just a restaurant; it’s a testament to the artistic potential of modern gastronomy. Led by chef Massimo Bottura, this three-Michelin-starred establishment has consistently been recognized as one of the best restaurants in the world, and for good reason.</p>
  
  <p>From the moment you step into the minimalist yet warm interior, you’re welcomed into a world where traditional Italian flavors are deconstructed and reimagined with contemporary flair. The journey begins with dishes like the '<strong>Five Ages of Parmigiano Reggiano</strong>,' a masterful exploration of the region's famed cheese, presented in five different textures and temperatures, showcasing the depth and versatility of this staple ingredient.</p>
  
  <p>The tasting menu reads like a love letter to Italy, with courses that evoke the landscape, history, and culture of the country. One standout dish, '<strong>The Crunchy Part of the Lasagna</strong>,' takes the best-loved element of a classic lasagna and turns it into a fine-dining delight, marrying nostalgic flavors with cutting-edge technique.</p>
  
  <p>Seafood lovers will be enchanted by the '<strong>Adriatic Sea</strong>,' where Bottura presents a dish that visually mimics the sea's surface, with raw fish and shellfish delicately arranged to evoke the feeling of a serene coastal evening.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Osteria Francescana</strong> is not afraid to play with expectations. The '<strong>Oops! I Dropped the Lemon Tart</strong>' is a deconstructed dessert that tells a story of imperfection, celebrating the beauty of spontaneity with a playful and delicious twist on a traditional tart.</p>
  
  <p>Pairing each course with carefully selected wines, the sommelier guides you through a liquid journey that complements and enhances the culinary experience. The wine list is a robust selection of Italian and international labels, reflecting Bottura’s commitment to offering the very best.</p>
  
  <p>But it’s not just the food that makes <strong>Osteria Francescana</strong> a must-visit. The service is impeccable, striking a perfect balance between professionalism and warmth, making every guest feel like a VIP. The attention to detail, from the presentation of the dishes to the pacing of the meal, ensures that dining here is an experience to be savored and remembered.</p>
  
  <p>As you conclude your meal with a rich espresso and perhaps a few final bites of the complimentary petit fours, you realize that <strong>Osteria Francescana</strong> is not just a restaurant; it’s a culinary narrative that invites you to explore the boundaries of flavor, technique, and tradition. It’s a place where food transcends its role as sustenance and becomes art.</p>

    restaurant: "Slow London",
    content: `
     <p>For me, London usually means a whirlwind of back-to-back meetings, events, and fleeting visits. However, last week was a refreshing change. I had the chance to stay at <strong>The Gantry</strong>, a hotel in Stratford, with dinner planned at <strong>Chino Latino</strong>, located just south of the river.</p>
  
  <p>To someone with a tightly packed schedule, staying almost an hour away from your evening destination might seem less than ideal. But if you find yourself in a similar situation, let me share why embracing a slower pace and viewing your own country or city through a tourist's eyes can be incredibly rewarding.</p>
  
  <h2>The Gantry, Stratford</h2>
  
  <p>Arriving at <strong>The Gantry</strong> after a busy day of meetings and a Central London lunch was a breath of fresh air. The calm and space of this out-of-city hotel were more than welcome. The vast lobby, adorned with intriguing coffee table books and thoughtfully curated art in each corridor, invited me to pause and appreciate the surroundings.</p>
  
  <p>Upon entering my room, I was immediately drawn to the expansive bed, perfectly positioned to offer a view of London Bridge, The Shard, and The London Eye through floor-to-ceiling windows. The room's decor is a polished blend of modern and heritage elements: leather with crisp cotton, an enveloping velvet sofa, copper light fixtures, and herringbone wood flooring. The bathroom is equally impressive, featuring honeycomb tiling, a concrete infinity vanity, and a generously sized rain shower stocked with luxurious Grown Alchemist products.</p>
  
  <p>The communal spaces at <strong>The Gantry</strong> are designed to encourage socializing and relaxation. The sweeping staircase leads you over the coffee shop, Hermanos, and past Grappelli, an Italian dining hall, and a market. The stairs bring you to <strong>Coupe</strong>, an intimate space focusing on sparkling wines, and beyond that, <strong>Union Social</strong>, a restaurant and lounge bar. Both offer indoor-outdoor terraces perfect for enjoying a Limoncello Spritz or a Basil Mezcalita on warm evenings.</p>
  
  <p>The best view is on the 18th floor at <strong>STK Steakhouse</strong>, where you can enjoy a menu featuring seafood and steak from around the world, complemented by weekend brunches and late-night DJs.</p>
  
  <h2>Chino Latino</h2>
  
  <p>Driving south to <strong>Chino Latino</strong> provided a perfect opportunity to unwind and catch up with my companion. Located in Park Plaza on Albert Embankment in Vauxhall, this venue offers a dramatic entrance. You ascend double escalators flanked by LED screens showcasing the Chino Latino logo, pass through a low-lit bar, and enter a restaurant with floor-to-ceiling views of The Thames glittering with evening lights.</p>
  
  <p>Despite the high ceilings, the atmosphere is vibrant, thanks to an 80’s playlist and striking visuals projected onto the walls. This cool, edgy backdrop sets the stage for a memorable dining experience.</p>
  
  <p>Having been a fixture for over a decade, <strong>Chino Latino</strong> excels with its Pan-Asian menu influenced by Peruvian flavors, crafted by Head Chef Ederson Bonasso. You could easily spend the entire meal exploring their small plates. Highlights include the delicate spinach-wrapped black cod with a zingy ponzu sauce and the Casterbridge beef taquitos, served in crisp masa cones with aji panca, jalapeno, and creamy avocado. Their skewers, served over hot coals, are a must-try.</p>

    restaurant: "Terre by Vincent Crepel",
    content: `
     <p>The lighting at Terre is dramatically low, casting a moody ambiance that sets the stage for an unforgettable dining experience. As we are guided through an opulent Georgian-style drawing room, complete with wing-backed chairs and warm mahogany, we pass corridors lined with an alchemist’s collection of ferments, pickles, and preserved treasures from both garden and sea. We continue into a sleek yet cozy dining room, featuring only three tables. Through the saloon doors, we catch a glimpse of a golden glow, a fiery flicker, and the familiar metallic clang of a professional kitchen at work. Outside, the moon rises over a majestic 12th-century castle and manicured stately labyrinth.</p>
  
  <p>Suddenly, the speaker system comes to life, blasting the iconic riff from Guns ‘n’ Roses’ “Sweet Child Of Mine.” Wait—what?</p>
  
  <p>It’s clear we’re not the first press group to crack a broad smile at this unexpected juxtaposition. Terre, a new restaurant aiming for two Michelin stars (the inspectors visited just a week before my visit), might not seem like the place where 90’s grunge and 70’s psychedelic rock would set the mood. Yet, Terre is an extension of chef patron Vincent Crepel’s unique personality, and it wasn’t long before everything fell into place.</p>
  
  <h2>Terre: A Journey through Flavor</h2>
  
  <p>Located within the 18th-century elegance of Castlemartyr Resort—a five-star country retreat nestled in 250 acres of pristine County Cork countryside—Terre embraces its eccentricities while defying gastronomic trends. Chef Vincent Crepel, with his quiffed hair and tattoos, has made a name for himself from Azark in San Sebastian to Singapore’s top eateries. Now, he’s bringing his innovative approach to the Irish countryside, making waves in a budding foodie scene.</p>
  
  <p>Crepel’s bold move to the countryside is a gamble, but his approach is all in. With a focus on local ingredients, minimal food miles, and a blend of global techniques, Terre not only meets but exceeds high expectations.</p>
  
  <h2>The Dining Experience</h2>
  
  <p>As we begin our meal, I admit to some apprehension when our maître d’ Fergus, a tall and besuited Irishman with an unmistakable grin, informs us we’re about to embark on a “journey.” This term is often overused, but at Terre, it genuinely applies. The dining experience is designed as a five-part journey, each stop showcasing Crepel’s vision and culinary prowess.</p>
  
  <p>Our journey starts with a fabulous vintage Blanc de Blancs champagne. As Axl Rose wails his nostalgic tunes, we are led through the rooms—each one uniquely atmospheric. The ferments room is a sight to behold, with jars of samphire, rosehip, rhubarb, sea purslane, and fennel flowers backlit dramatically. On the opposite wall, a collection of Michelin Guides dating back to 1984 hints at Crepel’s aspirations.</p>
  
  <p>Next, we are ushered into the open kitchen, where Vincent and his team greet us with a precise and theatrical “Welcome!” We take our places at the chef’s table, and the first course begins. One by one, the kitchen team presents their creations: a trio of one-bite delights in impossibly thin and crisp pastry cups. The first features smoked veal, anchovy, and sea purslane; the second, stone crab with finger lime and maple syrup (a key lime pie with a surprising twist); and the third, Ballycotton blue lobster with an assortment of botanicals. Each bite is distinct and delicious, setting the stage for a tasting menu that promises bold flavors and a remarkable dining experience.</p>

     <p><strong>“Is the astronaut’s helmet going to stay on?”</strong> I asked Jasper, the director.</p>
  <p><strong>“Yes, it’s been bolstered with bubble wrap,”</strong> he replied.</p>
  <p><strong>“Okay. Let’s go for a take then.”</strong></p>
  <p>It didn’t. The helmet rattled around the aerialist’s neck during the more dramatic scenes, making a national space agency cringe. <strong>Hackney, we have a problem.</strong> My only respite was lunch, a hasty affair from a fast food outlet that shall remain nameless. Spicy chicken—draw your own conclusions. I took fifteen minutes to stand in the frigid winter cold, enjoyed a Marlboro, and returned with the renewed zeal that only nicotine can provide. The crew was adamant about packing down by 4pm. I didn’t see it happening. I had dinner reservations, so even if I was right, I was leaving the set at 5pm bound for Mayfair.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>Smooth Sailing to Sexy Fish</strong></h2>
  
  <p>Sleekly positioned in Mayfair, <strong>Sensational Sexy Fish</strong> opened in 2015 with much fanfare. With its storied ownership, cost, and illustrious patrons, it quickly became a staple in the area. I’d heard about a new addition to Caprice Holdings through an old friend, <strong>Julian Sahut</strong>, formerly assistant head sommelier at the Dorchester’s China Tang. Sahut was moving to Sexy Fish as head sommelier. While a great wine list alone wouldn’t make me cross the country, Sahut’s move certainly did. Since I was already in London, it was the perfect opportunity to visit.</p>
  
  <p>The first hurdle when heading to the city for supper is parking. It’s notoriously difficult, especially around Berkeley Square, which can be a EuroPark nightmare. Of course, you can always arrive on foot or have your driver circle Mayfair before folding you back into the Phantom at the end of the night. By sheer luck, Greg spotted an ample space by the green. Naturally, we were suspicious. A parking space in Mayfair on a Friday night? We initially hesitated, assuming it was some new TFL scheme. But we took the chance, knowing another lap could take 20 minutes.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>Sexy Fish: An Evening to Remember</strong></h2>
  
  <p>Despite its prime location, the exterior of Sexy Fish is <strong>understated</strong>. Inside, however, the decor is nothing short of dramatic. The floors are made of rare <strong>esmeralda onyx marble</strong> imported from Iran. Above the red stone bar, a shoal of <strong>Frank Gehry fish lamps</strong> is guarded by bronze mermaids from <strong>Damien Hirst</strong>. Designed by <strong>Martin Brudnizki</strong>, the interiors feature Art Deco light fixtures, coral-colored leather banquettes, and a massive ceiling mural that covers the 190-seat restaurant. It’s bold, and I, for one, appreciate it. After all, <strong>dinner is not just a prelude to something else—it is the evening itself.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Having spent the afternoon as both negotiator and eye-roller, I needed a drink, ideally served by the yard. Instead, I opted for a slightly off-piste <strong>‘Clog Nine’</strong>: Applewood-infused gin, Absolut Elyx vodka, jasmine and coriander seed cordial, Mount Fuji bitters, and soda water. <strong>“What’s it like?”</strong> boomed Greg over the music. <strong>“Order one and find out,”</strong> I replied. I have a passing fancy for fine liquor, but I lacked the confidence to recreate something so complex. Rather than sample one of the 400 bottles from the world’s largest Japanese whisky collection, I stuck with the Clog Nine all evening—a solid seal of approval given the alternatives.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>Exploring the Menu</strong></h2>
  
  <p>With two cocktails under our belts, it was time to explore <strong>‘the list.’</strong> The champagne section boasts prestige cuvées like Salon’s Le Mesnil 2002 and Bruno Paillard’s Nec Plus Ultra 1996. There’s also a <strong>methuselah of DP 1995</strong> if you’re celebrating a small coup. Additionally, 10 fine wines are served by Coravin, including Château-Grillet 2007, and a selection of first growths culminating in a <strong>1982 Latour.</strong></p>
  
  <p>We decided to start with a bottle of <strong>Egon Muller’s Chateau Bela Riesling</strong>, chosen by the sommelier. I was low on decision-making energy, so I deferred to the experts. Some might find this challenging, but we extended the same trust to our supper order. With a fervently Asian menu featuring Thai, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean influences, dining out should be approached with abandon. I was eager to see <strong>which foot the team at Sexy Fish would lead with.</strong></p>

    restaurant: "Angelina",
    content: `
     <p>It was last November when I first received word that a new Japanese-Italian restaurant was opening in Dalston, East London. The invitation—<strong>for a preview dinner party</strong>—contained a certain ‘f’ word. No, not ‘food’, nor the other ‘f’ word so often used when eating out (example usage: ‘How — much?’). The word is—of course—<strong>‘fusion’</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>With trepidation, I accepted this invitation due to the track record of Japanese-Italian fusionists. While I’ll admit that I—and all food writers alike—suffer from the same affliction of ultracrepidarianism symptomatic of self-importance, in this regard, us sneery writers have been right. The road to culinary hell is well-paved with the intentions of past attempts. Boring, bland, and often over-priced; I have frequently wondered how one managed the mathematical anomaly of taking two positives—Japanese and Italian cuisine—and making a negative.</p>
  
  <p>My pre-emptive hostility, however, was unwarranted. A few feedings and half a year later, I am confident that <strong>Angelina</strong> is on to something special. What makes Angelina great is not forced, fanatical fusion but an exploration and appreciation of the commonalities of the two nations' produce and techniques. <strong>‘Fusion’—if mentioned at all—is very much tongue-in-cheek.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Undoubtedly, Angelina plays to her strengths. With a team whose backgrounds include <strong>Bocca di Lupo</strong> and <strong>River Café</strong>, it is unsurprising that the food has strong and robust Italian base notes. However, the skillful application of fresh Japanese accents enhances the traditional fare, satisfying the curiosity it attracts.</p>
  
  <p>The restaurant interior, on the other hand, has a predominantly Japanese vibe with clean, crisp lines and hanging lanterns. While there is an option to eat at the bar to watch the kitchen, I prefer the marble-topped tables of the restaurant floor, particularly as, when the Fritto Misto and the second course arrive, the table gets full quickly.</p>
  
  <p>Arriving on an array of beautiful Japanese porcelain, my partner and I armed ourselves with our forks en-garde; I was ready to use mine should he appear to be forking too much food in his own favor, and from his eyes, I knew he was thinking the same. Luckily, we avoided a scene of bloody proportions over portions because Angelina has the sense that seems to evade other establishments: a <strong>positive correlation of bites to persons present</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Explanation of the plates is quickfire:</strong> Japanese fried chicken with sake and mirin; soft shell tempura crab; tempura nettles stuffed with sausage; sea bream with yuzu and aged soy; bruschetta of unagi and gorgonzola; and cuttlefish with squid ink vinaigrette. That’s the summary version; it’s an understatement to say owner Joshua Owens-Baigler gets excited about the food, particularly the Japanese elements one may be less familiar with.</p>
  
  <p>For me, the standouts were the <strong>fried chicken</strong> and the <strong>bruschetta</strong>. For the former, think of it as the emperor of fried chicken—kinglier than kings and far superior to the lowly colonel. With the latter, unagi—so often the dominant flavor bullying weaker, inoffensive support acts—is made to compromise with the gorgonzola, resulting in a powerful but balanced double act.</p>
  
  <p>My other half continued to favor the <strong>tempura nettles</strong>, which are (thankfully) an Angelina staple and, for this visit, were stuffed with sausage meat. The sea bream crudo (or sashimi depending on your fancy) is further evidence of the team changing and improving upon core plates; the addition of yuzu made it the best version yet, with the hybrid citrus flavor providing a fresh cut to the batter crisp of the tempura.</p>
  
  <p>The third course led to <strong>‘ooh’s of interest</strong> at its appearance: sausage and clams atop daikon and verza, then topped with bright, almost fluorescent green caviar. It was fun and slightly alien-looking but tasted homely. I spent a while attempting to capture the last spheres of caviar on the plate with the prongs of my fork but failed miserably. After admitting defeat, I quickly finished the young Langhe Nebbiolo that accompanied this course.</p>
  
  <p>My visit to Angelina rounded off a busy week of dining out, where I experienced many good starts with mediocre middles. <strong>Thank the heavens above for Angelina</strong>. Brought to the table was lamb three-ways—and a rather good <strong>Barco Reale di Carmignano</strong>—roasted, grilled ‘the Roman Way,’ and finally in a little tortello shaped like a biretta hat. It was <strong>Perfection with a capital ‘P…lease bring me more’</strong>, and therefore my only complaint is that there was only one tortello.</p>
  
  <p>We finished with roasted peach, topped with a miso crumb, and a chocolate and amaretto sorbet—it was nothing showy, but as I was not on the rue de Bac, that doesn’t bother me. It was a dessert your mamma would make, using nonna’s recipe, after an adventurous holiday to Tokyo. Admittedly, the <strong>vin Santo di Carmignano</strong> was my partner’s favorite part, but seeing as he is usually as anti-chocolate as I am anti-fusionist, the fact he finished the whole thing speaks for itself (and also upset me as I would have happily gone in for seconds).</p>
  
  <p>So, what makes Angelina? By understanding that the partnership of Italy and Japan is less about forceful conquest and more about diplomatic respect for each other’s value, Angelina succeeds where others have failed. <strong>Fun, friendly, and scrumptious</strong>; an absolute pleasure.</p>
